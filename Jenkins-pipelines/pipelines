HOW MANY PIPELINES DO YOU KNOW IN JENKINS
2 TYPES OF PIPELINES 
DECLARATIVE
SCRIPTED 

NEXT QUESTION COMING TELL ME WHAT IS DIFFERENCE B/W DELCARATIVE AND SCRIPTED PIPELINES 
THEY BOTH USE GROVY SCRIPTING 

JENKIN STARTED WITH SCRIPTED PIPELINE AND SCRIPTED PIPELINE COMAPARE TO SIMPLER THEN DECLARATIVE AND EASY TO USE 
DRAWBACK OF SCRIPTED PIPELINES :
THEY DON'T HAVE LOT OF ADDITIONAL FEATURES WHERE AS DECLARATIVE PIPELINE HAS BIG MORE COMPLEX BUT THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL FEATURES

Declarative:

pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
       stage(build) {
       steps {
       }
    }
    stages {
       stage(Test) {
       steps {
       }
    }

}

Scripted :
node {
  stage ('build') {
  }
  stage('Test'){
  }
}
DECLARATIVE :
AGENT ANY MEANS WHICH SLAVE MACHINE YOU WOULD LIKE TO RUNE , YOU CAN CHOOSE THE NODE 
WHERE AS SCRIPTED PIPELINE THERE IS NO SUCH A CHOICE
